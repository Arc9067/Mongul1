          Mongul is an alien world-conqueror and the leader of Warworld. His
          brutal and merciless nature make him an enemy to Superman and a threat
          to the larger universe. His specialty is using the Black Mercy plants
          to incapacitate his opponents. Eventually he was murdered by Neron
          during Underworld Unleashed. His son is the second Mongul, who follows
          in his father's footsteps and later joins the Sinestro Corps.
